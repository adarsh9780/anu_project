As of now, I am learning LangGraph to upskill myself. 

In the main.py file, all my knowledge which I have learnt so far is present. But i feel it wouldn't be enough for people to hire me the role of Junior AI engineer (mostly a fresher role).

As your first task, please analyse the code and give me feedback, what is good, what can be improved etc. 

Then proceed to improve the Echo, the chatbot. I was thinking to give it a personality related to something along the books. 

I had a few ideas: based on the user's description, it can suggest books. This would require it to do a for a search query based on the user description, search internet, and analyse the search results, to better understand the books to recommned. Similarly suggest me more ideas.

The ideas should require me to do Context engineering, RAG and other important concepts.
